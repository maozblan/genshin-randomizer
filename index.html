      <h1>How to Use</h1>
      <p>
        For boss randomization, just go straight to RANDOMIZE, select the regions you want to include and click "randomize". If the Boss Count is left empty, it defaults to 1.
        If the boss count is higher than the amount of bosses possible in the current filter(s), it gives you the max number of different bosses. 
        Use the "prev" and "next" button to go through the randomized boss list. The list does not loop back, when "next" doesn't work anymore, you are at the end of the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        For character randomization first go to CHARACTER PROFILES / PROFILES to import or create profiles. Follow the directions on the profile creation page to indicate which characters are owned, not owned, or banned.
        Banned characters can be used for an extra layer of fun. The randomizer page allows for bans to be enforced or lifted through "toggle bans". Profiles also default to setting Kaeya, Amber, Lisa, Barbara to owned. Remember to select a Traveler.
        Then go to RANDOMIZE to randomize 4 characters depending on which profiles are chosen. Different profiles can be selected using the dropdowns for P1 to P4.

      <p>
          Hello! Welcome to the Genshin Randomizer. This is honestly just a small project
          made for my friends' Genshin adventures. However you have come across this page, welcome haha.
          You are free to use it too.
      </p>
      <p>
          Since this is a small project made for fun, it won't be as fancy as other websites out there.
          And content updates are done manually by me so please give me a couple of days...

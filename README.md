# Character Profiles  

Things to do:  
1. work out data storing and representation methods  
    1. espcially on profile creation page and profile display page  
1. Possibly look into other ways to store data  

## Profile Page Setup Brainstorming  

what I could do is make every character visible, and hover over with two buttons
1. Has Character (if current state unowned), Does Not Have Character (if current state is owned)
2. Ban Character

I was thinking that the character pfp could be normal for owned, greyscale ro unowned, and red for banned.
There should also be a button that hides all unowned characters.

Instead of hover buttons I could put buttons under the PFP but that gets a bit messy.

Do I need a character lookup system? (this could be one of the things held out until a lot later)

Certain characters could be permanantly set to owned.

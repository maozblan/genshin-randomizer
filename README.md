# things to do?

- [ ] got to add plenty of directional messages to guide people around

- [ ] "clear all" on profiles currently is set to clear local storage, need to patch before hosting any other project websites
- [ ] maybe implement a drag and drop into page to import profile csv...?
- [ ] if anyone can figure out why the translucent background on the profiles page is slightly larger than everywhere else, that would be nice :')

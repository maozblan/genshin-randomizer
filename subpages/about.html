      <h1>About This Page</h1>
      <p>
          Hello! Welcome to the Genshin Randomizer. This is honestly just a small project
          made for my friends' Genshin adventures. However you have come across this page, welcome haha.
          You are free to use it too.
      </p>
      <p>
          Since this is a small project made for fun, it won't be as fancy as other websites out there.
          And content updates are done manually by me so please give me a couple of days...
      </p>
      <p>
          ALL IMAGES BELONG TO HOYOVERSE/COGNOSPHERE OR WHATEVER THEY WANT TO CALL THEMSELVES NOW.
          Also special thanks to ChatGPT for carrying me through CSS and the framework xd.
